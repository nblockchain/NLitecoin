NLitecoin
---------

This library is a .NETStandard2.0 nuget package that:
- Is consumable from Mono/.NET4.x, but .NET6.0 or newer is recommended.
- Is written in F#.
- Is a better alternative to [NBitcoin.Altcoins' Litecoin](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin/blob/master/NBitcoin.Altcoins/Litecoin.cs) API & features.
- Depends on NBitcoin's nuget package.

Roadmap:
- ~Milestone1: Feature parity with NBitcoin.Altcoin's Litecoin utility (no need to reach 100% compatibility, just enough to make it work in geewallet)~
- Milestone2: MimbleWimble support.
